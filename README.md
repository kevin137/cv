## Professional Experience
 
### Ikusi  Donostia-San Sebastián, Spain

*Project Manager, Multimedia Business Unit (2012-currently)*

**Serving as Project Manager for customized, cloud-connected television headend**

updated transmitter IC to reduce EM emissions, exhibited improved manufacturability and durability. Collaborated with contract manufacturer and PCB fabricator to tune characteristic impedance to optimize signal integrity. Characterized the new assembly, which had improved signal quality, bit error rate, and lower overall cost.

**Led hardware and mechanical development for new multimedia headend**
Developed new modular headend architecture including a novel, cost-effective networking system for the control plane based on embeddeded USB--several current products are based on this platform and its derivatives. Designed, implemented, and tested new active cooling system for the platform. Led hardware design of all key PCBAs for the system, integrating new microprocessor, FPGA, DRAM system, and Ethernet IPcores. Collaborated with PCB fabricator to optimize performance and cost.

**Led design for networking subsystem of TV platform**
Including Ethernet switch module, bla,

### Molex Inc.  Maumelle, Arkansas
*Electrical Engineer, High Performance Adapters Business Unit (2005-2007)*

**Redesigned 4.25 gigabit/second Fibre Channel active copper cable assembly**
New design had updated transmitter IC to reduce EM emissions, exhibited improved manufacturability and durability. Collaborated with contract manufacturer and PCB fabricator to tune characteristic impedance to optimize signal integrity. Characterized the new assembly, which had improved signal quality, bit error rate, and lower overall cost.

**Developed 4.25 Gbps production test system including custom PCBs and FPGA-based pattern generator**
Tester required four new printed circuit boards assemblies, three with tightly confrolled impedance. Incorporated a customized Xilinx evaluation board programmed to generate test pattern. Coordinated development with mechanical engineer developing the enclosure, performed final assembly and testing, and shipped the tester to Mexico, where was in heavy use in a production line.

**Characterized adapters and cable assemblies**
Compliance testing for Fibre Channel, Infiniband, and Ethernet products required time domain reflectometry, eye diagrams, and bit error rate testing. Built custom assemblies and tuned equalizers for special sample requests. Documented results in detailed test reports for distribution to customers.

#### Tellabs Operations, Inc.  Naperville, Illinois
*Member of Technical Staff, Hardware Development  (2000-2003)*

**Developed automated test system in LabWindows/CVI**
Custom software controlled instruments, relay switch matrix, and device under test to measure signal quality characteristics and confirm compliance with Telcordia TI/EI standard. Test system could fully verify 28 T1 ports with no human intervention, saving hundreds of hours per verification cycle.

**Designed gigabit passive backplane for optical telecommunications system**
Hardware deliverable was production quality from the first prototype, saving tens of thousands of dollars and months of delay by eliminating the need for a second prototype. Design is now in production as a key component in product with hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue per year.

**Characterized connector and printed circuit board performance using time domain reflectometry**
Measured differential and single-ended signal paths, correlated test data to RF simulations, and performed 2.4 gigabit/second bit error rate testing, thoroughly documenting results.
