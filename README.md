## Professional Experience
 
### Ikusi  Donostia-San Sebasti√°n, Spain

*Project Manager, Multimedia Business Unit (2012-currently)*

**Serving as Project Manager for customized, cloud-connected television headend**  
Currently managing multi-year hardware/software/cloud project, coordinating product, features, timelines, and validation. 

**Led hardware and mechanical development for new multimedia headend**  
Developed modular headend architecture including a novel, cost-effective networking system for control based on embedded USB--several current products are based on this platform and its derivatives. Implemented new active thermal system for the platform. Led hardware design of all key PCBAs for the system, integrating new microprocessor, FPGA, DRAM systems, and Ethernet IPcores. Collaborated with PCB fabricators to optimize performance and cost of hardware, with firmware developers to rationalize and modularize devicetree, and mechanical designers to improve EMC.

**Led design for networking subsystem of TV platform**  
Specified, designed, and implemented streaming-optimized networking system, from hardware to VLAN level, from line card PHYs to backplane to switch fabric ASIC. System based on gigabit Ethernet integrates switching ASIC in custom modular hardware, and forms the backbone of Ikusi's current premium TV headend. Switch module also includes microprocessor and FPGA for headend control. Managed development of custom firmware for switch ASIC by external contractor. Developed validation protocols, and production test stand including bespoke hardware and software written in Ruby.

*R&D Technical Staff, Multimedia Business Unit (2007-2012)*

**Designed hardware for high-density H.264 transcoding module**  
System based on ASIC with fast multi-channel DDR3 and a PCI-e interface. Characterized and selected ICs for embedded Ethernet subsystem. Simulated signal integrity of PCI-e lanes using Keysight ADS. Miniaturized PCB layout by a factor of two compared to the ASIC reference design. Benchmarked transcoding performance, optimized thermal management system, developed and executed validation protocols, and cost-reduced the design for mass production. Transcoding systems installed in thousands of B2B locations for a major television operator in France.

**Developed hardware for network-enabled satellite television transmodulator**  
Module was first in its class to incorporate Ethernet networking. Simulated signal integrity of system bus using Zuken SI Verify. Improved DFM and cost of design by increasing integration, migrating PCB fabrication to high-volume overseas facilities, and optimizing mechanical design for assembly by robot. Developed and executed validation protocols, assisted production team with jigs and procedures for automation, and adapted hardware platform to new form factors for new products.

### Molex Inc.  Maumelle, Arkansas
*Electrical Engineer, High Performance Adapters Business Unit (2005-2007)*

**Redesigned 4.25 gigabit/second Fibre Channel active copper cable assembly**  
New design had updated transmitter IC to reduce EM emissions, exhibited improved manufacturability and durability. Collaborated with contract manufacturer and PCB fabricator to tune characteristic impedance to optimize signal integrity. Characterized the new assembly, which had improved signal quality, bit error rate, and lower overall cost.

**Developed 4.25 Gbps production test system including custom PCBs and FPGA-based pattern generator**  
Tester required four new printed circuit boards assemblies, three with tightly controlled impedance. Incorporated a customized Xilinx evaluation board programmed to generate test pattern. Coordinated development with mechanical engineer developing the enclosure, performed final assembly and testing, and shipped the tester to Mexico, where was in heavy use in a production line.

**Characterized adapters and cable assemblies**  
Compliance testing for Fibre Channel, Infiniband, and Ethernet products required time domain reflectometry, eye diagrams, and bit error rate testing. Built custom assemblies and tuned equalizers for special sample requests. Documented results in detailed test reports for distribution to customers.
